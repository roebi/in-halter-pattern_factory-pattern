# CH CONST1 - Code Const

## Project: domain driven, reusable and immutable constant values for java programming language

When you write Unittests with many Data Values

you write many constant values

- Strings
- Numbers

for

- Setting
- Searching
- Validating

direct in your code.

## This is a approach to define reusable and immutable constant values as simple as possible.

First start small

- with immutable, domain driven values.

Each constant value

- `public static final`
